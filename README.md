# Hi, I'm Ashwin 👋

I'm a Data Analyst with hands-on experience in SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel. I enjoy working with data — cleaning it, modeling it, and turning it into dashboards that actually make sense to business users.

Currently building my portfolio through real-world projects and constantly learning.

## What I work with

- **SQL** — writing queries, designing schemas, building data models
- **Power BI** — data modeling, DAX, interactive dashboards
- **Tableau** — visual analytics and storytelling
- **Excel** — data cleaning, pivot tables, early-stage dashboards

## Projects

### 📈 Stock Market Analytics
An end-to-end BI project I built as part of my Data Analyst training. Designed a star schema in MySQL, built the data pipeline from Excel, and created dashboards in both Power BI and Tableau tracking KPIs like Portfolio Return, Sharpe Ratio, Trade Win Rate, and Market Capitalization.
